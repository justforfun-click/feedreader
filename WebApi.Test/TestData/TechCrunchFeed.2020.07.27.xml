										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple is expanding its relationship with media mogul Oprah Winfrey. The company announced today its plans for a new series, &#8220;The Oprah Conversation,&#8221; which will feature timely discussions between Oprah and &#8220;newsmakers, though leaders and masters of their craft&#8221; across a range of topics. The first few episodes will focus on conversations around race, given recent events like the BLM protests.</p>
<p>The series, which was filmed remotely during the pandemic, will begin on July 30 at  4 PM PST with an episode titled &#8220;How to Be an Antiracist,&#8221; which will see Oprah and bestselling author Professor Ibram X. Kendi talking with book readers who are on a journey to learn how to become anti-racist. This episode will then be followed by a two-part interview with athlete, commentator, activist and creator and host of &#8220;Uncomfortable Conversations with a Black Man,&#8221; Emmanuel Acho on August 1.</p>
<p>Oprah will also converse with Equal Justice Initiative founder and bestselling author Bryan Stevenson later in the series.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The show&#8217;s format will include Oprah speaking with guests, but will also incorporate audience engagement, like viewer questions.</p>

<p>This is the third series that Oprah is now doing for Apple, having <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/23/oprah-winfreys-new-apple-tv-show-oprah-talks-covid-19-arrives-for-free-streaming/">launched</a> &#8220;Oprah Talks COVID-19&#8221; in late March, and &#8220;Oprah&#8217;s Book Club&#8221; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/23/oprahs-book-club-comes-to-apple-tv/">last year</a>, as part of her multi-year agreement with the company. Another show, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/10/prince-harry-is-partnering-with-oprah-winfrey-on-apple-tv-series-about-mental-health/">produced in partnership</a> with Prince Harry and focused on mental health, has yet to arrive. Oprah also participated in Apple&#8217;s documentary series, &#8220;Visible: Out on Television.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unfortunately for Apple, Oprah&#8217;s multi-year deal is overlapping with a pandemic which has shut down TV production leading to the launch of these &#8220;filmed remotely&#8221;-style series.</p>
<p>Oprah&#8217;s COVID series, for example, was quickly put together in reaction to the health crisis and used lower production values, making it a first of its kind on Apple TV+. Before its arrival, Apple TV+ content had been highly produced and offered in 4K. But those initial experiments in remote TV production made further shows like this new series possible.</p>
<p>While much of Apple TV+ content requires a subscription, &#8220;The Oprah Conversation&#8221; will debut exclusively on the service for free on Thursday, July 30, Apple says. After the first free episode, the remainder of the series will require a $4.99 per month Apple TV+ subscription to view. The Apple TV+ service is available across devices, including Apple&#8217;s own, as well as select smart TVs, Amazon Fire TV, and Roku.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Everyone wants more bandwidth from the skies, but it takes a lot of testing to turn laboratory research projects into real-world performant infrastructure. A number of new technologies, sometimes placed under the banner of “5G” and sometimes not, is embarking on that transition and being deployed in real-world scenarios.</p>
<p>Those research trials are crucial for productizing these technologies, and ultimately, delivering consumers better wireless broadband options.</p>
<p>We’ve talked a bit about one of those testbeds <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/26/5g-wireless/">called COSMOS up in northern Manhattan near Columbia University</a>, which is pioneering 5G technologies within a dense urban environment. The same National Science Foundation-funded research group that financed that project, the <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=505316__;!!Op6eflyXZCqGR5I!VGxNfnCYRs8yNFbsiHFmw7jVp3y3gGABbBGF6Rq6eEHUsLUl6ooBYw_2fWyvbiw$ ">Platforms for Advanced Wireless Research</a> program (PAWR), has now selected two finalists for its fourth location, which has a specific focus on rural infrastructure.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="u3Nk9SAIP3"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/26/5g-wireless/">The 5G wireless revolution will come, if your city council doesn’t block it first</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The 5G wireless revolution will come, if your city council doesn’t block it first&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/26/5g-wireless/embed/#?secret=u3Nk9SAIP3" data-secret="u3Nk9SAIP3" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Research teams in Ames, Iowa affiliated with the Iowa State University and Lincoln, Nebraska affiliated with the University of Nebraska-Lincoln each won $300,000 grants to accelerate their planning for the testbeds. Those teams will use the grants to optimize their proposals, with one expected to receive the final full grant next year.</p>
<p>The goal for this latest testbed is to find next-generation wireless technology stacks that can deliver cheaper and better bandwidth to rural America, areas of the country that are not well-served by traditional cable and fiber networks nor current wireless cell tower coverage.</p>
<p>Whoever wins will join the existing three wireless testbeds in New York City, Salt Lake City, and the Research Triangle in North Carolina.</p>
<p>PAWR itself is a joint public-private initiative with $100 million in funding to accelerate America’s frontier wireless innovation. It’s co-led by <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/usignite/index.jsp__;!!Op6eflyXZCqGR5I!VGxNfnCYRs8yNFbsiHFmw7jVp3y3gGABbBGF6Rq6eEHUsLUl6ooBYw_2d0cJOpE$ ">US Ignite</a>, a NSF run initiative to bring smart city ideas to fruition, and Northeastern University.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Joseph Kitonga, the 23-year-old entrepreneur behind <a href="https://www.vitablehealth.com/">Vitable Health</a>, first saw the need for a new kind of healthcare service growing up in Philadelphia and seeing the experience of the home healthcare workers who worked at his parents&#8217; business.</p>
<p>The Kitongas immigrated to the United States a decade ago and settled down in Philadelphia, where they started a home-care business matching workers with patients in need. What was surprising to the younger Kitonga was that the people who worked for his parents taking care of others couldn&#8217;t afford basic healthcare coverage themselves.</p>
<p>It was that observation that provided the seed for the business idea that would become Vitable Health, Kitonga&#8217;s first business and a recent member of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/y-combinator" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="y-combinator">Y Combinator&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> latest summer cohort.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company provides affordable acute healthcare coverage to underinsured or un-insured populations and was born out of his experience watching employees of his parents&#8217; home healthcare agency struggle to receive basic healthcare coverage.</p>
<p>A lot of caregivers make $10 per hour, which is too much to qualify for Medicaid and too little to afford health insurance, Kitonga says.</p>
<p>Even with the Affordable Care Act, many workers in the home-care business that Kitonga&#8217;s parents ran in Philadelphia were unable to receive care.</p>
<p>So Kitonga built a service that could cover everything but catastrophic coverage for lower costs than the company&#8217;s customers would have to pay if they went to an urgent care facility.</p>
<p>Vitable is able to lower the cost of care through its use of nurse practitioners instead of doctors to provide the care. For a small monthly fee, the company will send providers to make house calls or customers can receive a consultation over the phone.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We focus on acute and preventive coverage,&#8221; says Kitonga. &#8220;Most high deductible plans are geared toward providing catastrophic coverage.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>What Kitonga saw with his parents&#8217; employees was that they would wind up going to the emergency room and put $1,300 in charges on their credit cards rather than pay for insurance per month.</p>
<p>Vitable&#8217;s lowest plan levels start at $15 per month and the co-payment is $30, according to Kitonga. Vitable&#8217;s technicians will do in-home lab tests.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s just no low-cost care option available for the population that Kitonga wants to serve, he said. These are people who will be referred to emergency rooms by nearby care providers because they lack the necessary insurance. &#8220;The population that we service has been ignored by healthcare providers,&#8221; said Kitonga.</p>
<p>For now, the service is only available in Philadelphia, but Kitonga says there are already 1,000 people who receive care through Vitable. &#8220;We work with a lot of small businesses that might have 10 or 20 employees,&#8221; Kitonga said.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The company&#8217;s $1.5 billion valuation is courtesy of a new $200 million investment from existing investors led by <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/general-catalyst-partners" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="general-catalyst-partners">General Catalyst <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and including <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/firstmark-capital-2135" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="firstmark-capital-2135">FirstMark Capital, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Torch, SignalFire, TQ Ventures, Initialized Capital, 3L and BoxGroup.

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;This new investment will further our mission to become every patient’s first call. We’ll continue to invest in our vertically-integrated healthcare ecosystem, from our Collaborative Care Center to our national pharmacy operating system. This is just the beginning of Ro’s patient-centered healthcare platform.” </span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s all part of the company&#8217;s mission to provide a point of entry into the healthcare system independent of insurance qualifications.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Telehealth companies like Ro are using technology to address long-standing healthcare disparities that have been exacerbated by COVID-19,&#8221; said Dr. Joycelyn Elders, MD, Ro Medical Advisor and Former U.S. Surgeon General. &#8220;By empowering providers to leverage their skills as efficiently and effectively as possible, Ro delivers affordable, high-quality care regardless of a patient’s location, insurance status, or physical access to physicians and pharmacies.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Ro&#8217;s new financing is one of several forays by tech investors into reshaping the healthcare system at a time when patient care has been severely disrupted by attempts to mitigate the spread of COVID-19.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Digital medicine is assuming a central position in the healthcare world, with most consultations now occurring online. Reimbursement schemes for telemedicine have changed dramatically and investors see an opportunity to capitalize on these changes by aggressively backing the expansion plans of companies looking to bring digital healthcare directly to consumers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">That&#8217;s one of the reasons why Ro&#8217;s major competitor, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/hims" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="hims">Hims, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is reported to be seeking access to public markets through its sale to a special purpose acquisition company for roughly $1 billion, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hims-spac-idUSKCN24N1WZ">according to Reuters</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 paved the way for decades of incremental changes to the way buildings, businesses, and laws accommodate people with a wide variety of disabilities. At 30 years old this week, the law&#8217;s effect on tech has been profound, but there&#8217;s still a <em>lot</em> of work to do.</p>
<p>The ADA originally applied mainly to things like buildings and government resources, but over the years (and with improvements and amendments) came to be much broader than that. As home computers, the web, and eventually apps became popular, they too became subject to ADA requirements — though to what extent is still a matter under debate.</p>
<p>I asked a few prominent companies and advocacy organizations what they think about how tech has improved the everyday lives of people with disabilities, and where it has so far fallen short.</p>
<p>Those who responded had the most to say about how tech has helped, of course, but also offered suggestions (and recriminations) for an industry that has in some ways only recently begun to truly include people with disabilities in its processes — and in many ways has yet to do so.</p>
<h3>Claire Stanley, Advocacy and Outreach Specialist at the American Council for the Blind</h3>
<p>&#8220;Tech has opened the door to <em>so</em> many things,&#8221; said Stanley. &#8220;Books, for instance — 10 years ago to get a book you might have to wait for the Library of Congress to convert it to audio. Now, because of Kindles and e-readers, the day a book comes out I can buy it. Access is a <em>lot</em> faster than it once was.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/CMB_4796.jpg"><img class="breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1732344" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/CMB_4796.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/CMB_4796.jpg 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/CMB_4796.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/CMB_4796.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/CMB_4796.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/CMB_4796.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/CMB_4796.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/CMB_4796.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/CMB_4796.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>&#8220;The ability to do certain things in the workplace, too. The caveat is, people don&#8217;t always design software to work with accessibility technology. Designing with screen readers in mind can be very helpful, but if they don&#8217;t, that opens up whole new problems,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Companies just don&#8217;t think about accessibility, so they design a product that&#8217;s totally inaccessible to screen readers. To my understanding, if you design it right from the get go it should be easy to make it compatible. There are the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/">WCAG standards</a> — if programmers took even a cursory glance at these, they&#8217;d be like, oh I get it!,&#8221; said Stanley. &#8220;And I&#8217;ve heard from a lot of people that when you make something accessible to the blind it makes it better for everybody.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s exactly the problem that<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/27/fable-aims-to-make-disability-inclusive-design-as-simple-as-a-service/"> Fable intends to alleviate</a> by providing software testers with various disabilities as a service to companies that may not have thought that far ahead in their QA process.</p>

<p>New devices and services are also changing the landscape for blind folks:</p>
<p>&#8220;Braille literacy is going down because people are turning to audio synthesizers — but new designs of braille readers are coming out, and they&#8217;re getting cheaper. I have mine right next to me,&#8221; said Stanley.</p>
<p>Of course for the deaf-blind community braille is still indispensable. One dad hoping to teach his daughter braille recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/18/the-becdot-is-a-toy-that-helps-teach-vision-impaired-kids-to-read-braille/">built his own inexpensive braille education device</a> — not something you were likely to do 20 years ago.</p>

<p>&#8220;And Aira is an app that has been around for about four years &#8211; basically, though video from your phone, a person on the other end can answer questions and identify things. I use it all the time. They&#8217;re starting to integrate AI to do some simple things like read signs,&#8221; Stanley said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve also been working a lot in the autonomous vehicle space. That will open up a lot of doors, and not just for blind people, but people with other disabilities, the elderly, children,&#8221; she added. &#8220;I know we have a long way to go, but we&#8217;ve been fortunate enough to be at the table with companies and Congress when we&#8217;re talking about what making an autonomous vehicle accessible looks like.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Eve Andersson, Director of Accessibility at Google</h3>
<p>&#8220;To me, one of the most notable tech advances has been changes in captioning technology. About two years after I started at <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> in 2009, we introduced automatic captioning on YouTube using AI. Then 8 years later, we introduced the ability to caption sound effects (laughter, music, applause, etc) to make video content even more accessible,&#8221; said Andersson.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/jLCwjIaPXwA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>She pointed out that although captions were originally made with accessibility for deaf and hard of hearing users, they quickly became helpful for many other users who wanted to be able to watch videos on mute, in other languages, and so on. <span id="m_8957363163927552247gmail-docs-internal-guid-bab1d7d5-7fff-080a-c825-f61aa1d66950"></span></p>

For example, speech recognition and voice assistants have made it possible to have the speech to text features that we have today, like voice typing in Google Docs or dictation in Chrome OS,&#8221; she said.<br />

<p>Live transcribe is another feature that tech has enabled, letting hearing impaired people follow in-person communications live.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span id="m_8957363163927552247gmail-docs-internal-guid-bab1d7d5-7fff-080a-c825-f61aa1d66950">Before the ADA, some parts of the physical world remained inaccessible to people who are blind or low-vision,&#8221; Andersson said. &#8220;Today, you can find braille under almost all signs in the United States, which paved the way for us to create products like <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.googlecode.eyesfree.brailleback&amp;hl=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id%3Dcom.googlecode.eyesfree.brailleback%26hl%3Den_US&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1595953456519000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHvo_zg_YdNjSLkcGxKU2bPhRKf2Q">Google BrailleBack</a> and the <a href="https://blog.google/products/android/braille-keyboard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://blog.google/products/android/braille-keyboard/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1595953456519000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFQJKoXCoL6DCyMMRst75T3m-LcSw">TalkBack braille keyboard</a>, which both allow braille users to gain the information they need and communicate effectively with the world around them. In addition, the spirit of ADA in making the physical world accessible to people with disabilities is what inspired innovations like <a href="https://www.blog.google/outreach-initiatives/accessibility/lookout-discover-your-surroundings-help-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.blog.google/outreach-initiatives/accessibility/lookout-discover-your-surroundings-help-ai/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1595953456519000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHKoeZtiAzDCIsF4TMo52SLGOk62w">Lookout</a>, an app that helps people who are blind or low-vision identify the world around them.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&#8220;<span id="m_8957363163927552247gmail-docs-internal-guid-bab1d7d5-7fff-080a-c825-f61aa1d66950">One area that we’re thinking about more and more is how to leverage technology to be more helpful for people with cognitive disabilities. This is an incredibly diverse space spanning many different needs, but it remains largely unexplored,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Action blocks&#8221; in Android are an early effort to address it, simplifying multi-step processes into single buttons. But the team is looking into larger scale improvements to help out those who have trouble using a smart device out of the box.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;As an industry, we need to work to ensure that people with disabilities – from employees to consultants to users – are always included in the process of developing a product, research area, or initiative from the very beginning,&#8221; she said. &#8220;People with disabilities or who have family members with disabilities on my team bring their experiences to the table and we make better products as a result.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Sarah Herrlinger, Director of Global Accessibility Policy at Apple</h3>
<p>&#8220;It’s fundamentally about culture,&#8221; said Herrlinger. &#8220;From the beginning <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="apple">Apple <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has always believed accessibility is a human right and this core value is still evident in everything we design today.&#8221;</p>
<p>Though somewhat general of a statement, Apple has the history to back it up. The company has famously been ahead of others on the accessibility curve for decades. TechCrunch columnist Steve Aquino has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/05/apples-global-accessibility-head-on-the-companys-new-accessibility-features/">documented</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/09/apple-puts-accessibility-features-front-and-center/">these</a> efforts over the years, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/19/when-it-comes-to-accessibility-apple-continues-to-lead-in-awareness-and-innovation/">summing many up in this feature</a>.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2008525" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/accessibility-apple.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2008525" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2008525" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/accessibility-apple.jpg" alt="Accessibility features on the Apple iPhone" width="1024" height="632" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/accessibility-apple.jpg 1417w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/accessibility-apple.jpg?resize=150,93 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/accessibility-apple.jpg?resize=300,185 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/accessibility-apple.jpg?resize=768,474 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/accessibility-apple.jpg?resize=680,420 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/accessibility-apple.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2008525" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>The iPhone, being Apple&#8217;s flagship product since its introduction, has also been its main platform for accessibility.</p>
<p>&#8220;The historical impact of iPhone as a mainstream consumer product is well documented. What is less understood though is how life changing iPhone and our other products have been for disability communities,&#8221; said Herrlinger. &#8220;Over time iPhone has become the most powerful and popular assistive device ever. It broke the mold of previous thinking because it showed accessibility could in fact be seamlessly built into a device that all people can use universally.&#8221;</p>
<p>The feature that has been helpful to the most people is likely VoiceOver, which intelligently reads off the contents of the screen in a way that allows blind users to navigate the OS easily. One such user posted her experience recently, racking up millions of views:</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>As for where the tech industry has room to grow, Herrlinger said: &#8220;Representation and inclusion are critical. We believe in the mantra of many within disability communities: ‘Nothing about us without us.’ We started a dedicated accessibility team in 1985, but like all things on inclusion — accessibility should be everyone’s job at Apple.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Melissa Malzkuhn, Founder &amp; Creative Director, Motion Light Lab at Gallaudet University</h3>
<p>&#8220;If not for the laws in place to safeguard our access, no one would implement them,&#8221; Malzkuhn said frankly. &#8220;The ADA really helped push greater access, but we also saw a lot of change in how people think, and what is considered socially responsible. More and more people now see that their use of social media comes with a sense of social responsibility to make their posts accessible. We would like to see that social accountability with all individuals, and with all companies, big and small.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gallaudet.edu/about">Gallaudet</a> is a university that aims to be &#8220;barrier-free for deaf and hard of hearing students,&#8221; providing a huge amount of resources and instruction for that community. Many of the technologies its staff has used for years have seen major improvements as mainstream users have flocked to virtual meetings and the like and found them wanting.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2022922" style="width: 530px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/teams-captions.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2022922" class="size-full wp-image-2022922" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/teams-captions.png" alt="A video meeting showing live captions" width="520" height="292" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/teams-captions.png 520w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/teams-captions.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/teams-captions.png?resize=300,168 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/teams-captions.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 520px) 100vw, 520px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2022922" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Microsoft</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;We have more video meeting options than ever, and they continue to improve. We also have seen a constant improvement in our experience with video relay services,&#8221; Malzkuhn said. She also cited voice-to-text as having improved a lot and provided serious utility; Gallaudet&#8217;s Technology Access Program has worked with Google&#8217;s Live Transcribe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Language-mapping processing, and the early pioneering work on gesture and sign recognition is exciting,&#8221; she added, though the latter is still a ways from practical use. She was unsparing in her criticism of the many attempts at smart gloves, however: &#8220;Enough with the sign language gloves. It reinforces a bigger ideology: Give deaf people something to wear and our communication issues will go away. It is not about putting the burden of communication on one group of people.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would say that the Apple iPad has revolutionized how we look at the experience of reading for deaf children. In the Motion Light Lab here at <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/gallaudet-university" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="gallaudet-university">Gallaudet University, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> we have created bilingual storybook apps, intersecting both ASL videos and written text on the same interface,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But technology will never replace the humanity in all of us. All it takes are attitudes and the willingness to communicate, regardless of technology. Learning a bit of sign language goes a long way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Malzkuhn emphasized the value of inclusion and chastised companies that fail to take even elementary steps in hiring and process.</p>
<p>&#8220;Companies that hire Deaf people have it right. Companies that focus on inclusive design and accessibility as an important and &#8216;non-negotiable&#8217; aspect in product design also have it right. Their products are invariably superior to inaccessible products,&#8221; she said, while those who do not are guilty of &#8220;a serious omission. Many companies strive to create products to &#8216;help&#8217; our lives, but if we are not in the room in the first place, and if we do not have a seat at the table, that is not helpful. Inclusive design starts with an inclusive team.&#8221;</p>
<p>Investors need to look at startups focused on accessibility and deafness as well. Like any growing community, they need funding and mentorship.</p>
<p>Malzkuhn also wanted to make sure that companies are thinking about the deaf and hard of hearing not just as consumers of an end product, but full-fledged users.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is a driving force in my work &#8212; we need to always give tools so anyone can design technology. We need to ensure that we have the responsibility of training, teaching, and making those accessible so we develop and cultivate the next generation of young deaf people who design and construct, who are architects of systems, who can program systems, as well as being end users of technology.&#8221;</p>

<h3>Jenny Lay-Flurrie, Chief Accessibility Officer at Microsoft</h3>
<p>&#8220;On a personal level, the ADA drove a new bar of awareness and provision of captioning, interpreting which are both invaluable to me in the workplace, home, and navigating crucial life needs like medical care,&#8221; said Lay-Flurrie. &#8220;Technology can unlock solutions that can help empower people with disabilities in the spirit of the ADA and lead to greater innovations for everyone. To enable transformative change accessibility needs to be a priority.&#8221;</p>
<p>Like Google&#8217;s Eve Andersson, Lay-Flurrie highlighted captioning as a major recent advance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Captioning, like many other aspects of accessibility is increasingly woven into the fabric of what we do,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Captioning has evolved so much in the last 30 years, and accelerated as a result of AI and ML in the last 5. Teams now has AI captioning integrated and we have seen the impact of that during COVID with Teams Captioning usage up 30x from a few months prior.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Accessibility has also diversified – with technologies like Seeing AI, Learning Tools, and the Xbox Adaptive Controller as <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/microsoft" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="microsoft">Microsoft <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> focuses on inclusive design, building with and for people with disabilities in these instances, creating breakthrough technologies for blind/low vision, dyslexia and mobility,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The Adaptive Controller was one of the best hardware surprises of recent years — a device for playing games and interacting with computers and consoles that&#8217;s hyper-compatible and clearly the result of immense effort and expenditure.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="43pjJPZyYR"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/17/microsofts-xbox-adaptive-controller-is-an-inspiring-example-of-inclusive-design/">Microsoft&#8217;s Xbox Adaptive Controller is an inspiring example of inclusive design</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Microsoft&#8217;s Xbox Adaptive Controller is an inspiring example of inclusive design&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/17/microsofts-xbox-adaptive-controller-is-an-inspiring-example-of-inclusive-design/embed/#?secret=43pjJPZyYR" data-secret="43pjJPZyYR" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>It&#8217;s an example of one of the &#8220;doors that remain closed and need to be opened, vehemently and with speed,&#8221; as Lay-Flurrie put it. &#8220;Seeing AI is a great lens on what is possible here, and I get excited to think about what AI/ML, as well as AR can do across the spectrum of disability. Additionally, we believe that AI can help unlock solutions to some of the biggest challenges people with disabilities face, which is why the AI for Accessibility program plays a crucial role in how Microsoft is working to drive inclusive innovation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lay-Flurrie had a good deal to say on how to integrate inclusivity into a company&#8217;s processes — and with good reason, seeing as Microsoft has been a leader on these issues for years.</p>
<p>&#8220;Accessibility isn’t optional. It must be part of your business, ecosystem and managed/measured,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It starts with people and we have really focused on how we build an inclusive culture, pipeline of talent. Though we are still continuing to grow and learn, have also taken steps to share our learnings with other organizations through resources like the Autism Hiring Playbook, Accessibility at a Glance training resources, the Supported Employment Program Toolkit, and the Inclusive Design Toolkit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We realize that each organization has its own pace and starting point. The first step is to recognize the need to design for accessibility,&#8221; she continued. &#8220;It’s particularly important to evaluate the maturity of a product development lifecycle through the lens of accessibility and look to build in assistive features from the start, not bolted on later in the process. But there is more to do here. Until then, my mantra stands – if you don’t know its accessible, its not.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Mike Shebanek, Head of Accessibility at Facebook</h3>
<p>&#8220;The portability, ease of use, affordability, and built-in accessibility of smartphones has allowed people with disabilities to be more connected, more mobile and more independent than anyone thought possible thirty years ago,&#8221; said Shebanek. &#8220;The rise of voice technologies like speech synthesis, speech recognition, and voice control of devices has also radically improved the lives of people with disabilities.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="facebook">Facebook <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> created React Native, and made it open source, so that developers can create accessible mobile apps. We’ve also helped set global digital standards for web accessibility that enable everyone to enjoy a more accessible Internet,&#8221; he continued.</p>
<p>Like the others, he suggests that tech companies need to consider accessibility needs and methods early on, and increase the numbers of people with disabilities in the development and testing process.</p>
<p>Machine learning is helping address some major obstacles in a more automated way: &#8220;we’re using it at Facebook to power automatic video captioning and create automatic Alt-Text to provide spoken descriptions of photographs to people who are blind,&#8221; said Shebanek. &#8220;But these are only recent innovations and the industry has barely begun to scratch the service of what’s possible in the next 30 years as we begin to thoughtfully address the needs of people with disabilities.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the filing, reported by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-amazon-com/california-probing-amazon-worker-treatment-during-pandemic-court-says-idUSKCN24S2DO">Reuters</a>, a San Francisco Superior Court Judge Ethan Schulman writes that California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, California&#8217;s Division of Occupational Safety and Health and San Francisco&#8217;s Department of Public Health have all opened investigations into the online retail giant&#8217;s workplace practices in light of the pandemic. The Attorney General&#8217;s office declined to comment when reached by TechCrunch.</p>

<p>While Amazon faced frequent criticism for worker well being before the pandemic, the ongoing crisis has made those concerns even more stark. With white-collar workers sent home, the virus has spread quickly through clusters of employees at factory floors and warehouses nationwide where social distancing isn&#8217;t enforced. Amazon&#8217;s own shipping centers have reported outbreaks, including one in the Pocono Mountains and another in Oregon and by May <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/22/an-eighth-amazon-warehouse-employee-has-died-from-covid-19/">eight Amazon warehouse workers</a> had died from the virus.</p>
<p>The disclosure of the three California state investigations came out of court case accusing Amazon of failing to adequately protect workers in a San Francisco Amazon Fresh Fulfillment Center. In the <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/06/11/coronavirus-lawsuit-bay-area-amazon-groceries-warehouse-a-threat-to-workers-public/">lawsuit</a>, filed in March, Amazon Fresh worker Chiyomi Brent accuses the company of taking risks, including sharing the suits they wear into freezers without cleaning them after each use. Brent also filed a complaint with California&#8217;s Division of Occupational Safety and Health, which is now looking into Amazon&#8217;s distribution center practices.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;Tenet&#8221; has long been expected to be a bellwether for filmgoers’ readiness to return to theaters. Director Christopher Nolan is a blockbuster machine, and if anyone can get butts in seats amid the worst pandemic in modern memory, it’s probably him. And to be fair, the film really has served as a kind of litmus test — just not the kind Warner Bros. was hoping for. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/26/warner-bros-pushes-back-tenet-release-as-covid-19-cases-surge-in-several-states/">numerous delays</a>, Tenet has a new release date. Not a final release date, mind. If there’s one thing that COVID-19 has taught us, it’s that things can always get worse. For now, however, the mysterious sci-fi thriller is slated to hit theaters in select North American cities on September 3, for the Labor Day weekend. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Notably, however, the film will receive an international release in 70 territories next month. The list includes Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, Russia and the U.K. While U.S. theater owners have eagerly been awaiting the film’s arrival, shutdowns in too many key markets have continued to make a wide release untenable. Among other things, the move can be viewed as a kind of indictment of the United States’ ongoing inability to curb the virus’s spread. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And while, <a href="https://variety.com/2020/film/box-office/tenet-release-date-international-movie-theaters-1234717187/">as Variety notes</a>, global day-and-date releases aren’t unheard of for these kinds of blockbusters, much of Tenet’s appeal has hinged on the film’s mysterious nature. The trailers thus far released for the film have remained purposefully obtuse. An international release ahead of the U.S. will almost certainly go a long ways toward removing some of that mystery through piracy and online spoilers. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Other upcoming releases &#8220;Mulan&#8221; and &#8220;A Quiet Place 2&#8221; have also seen further delays in recent days. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">BMW said it will offer the all-electric versions of X1 compact SUV and the 5 Series as part of the German automaker&#8217;s plans to have 25 electrified models in its portfolio by 2023.</p>
<p>BMW didn&#8217;t say exactly when an all-electric X1 or 5 Series might be available (TechCrunch reached out and will update if we get an answer). The all-electric drive train will be one of four options to buyers of the BMW X1 and BMW 5 Series vehicles. The sedan and SUV are also available as a plug-in hybrid, as well as diesel or gas with 48-volt mild hybrid technology.</p>
<p>The two vehicles are the latest to join BMW&#8217;s expanding electrified portfolio. Earlier this year, the automaker said its flagship 7 series sedan would also be offered with an all-electric drive train.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>BMW has said that half of the 25 &#8220;electrified&#8221; models slated to be on roads by 2023 will be fully electric. The term electrified can also mean a hybrid and plug-in hybrid. The company&#8217;s longer-term goal is to have more than 7 million electrified BMW Group vehicles on the road by 2030. BMW has said it wants two-thirds of those to have a fully-electric drive train.</p>
<p>The automaker is bringing five all-electric vehicles to market by the end of 2021, including the BMW i3, the Mini Cooper SE, the BMW iX3, the BMW iNEXT and the BMW i4. The i3 is a well-known member of the wider EV industry. But the others likely less so. The Mini Cooper SE has the i3 motor and with 110 miles of EPA-rated range from its 32.6-kWh battery, the vehicle is marketed as a fun-to-drive urban commuter.</p>
<p>The iX3, which is based off the X3, is an electric crossover that will be assembled in China. The iX3 is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/09/bmw-axes-plans-to-bring-electric-ix3-suv-to-u-s/">not coming to the United States</a>. Instead, the vehicle will go on sale in the first half of 2021 in China.</p>
<p>The<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/03/the-bmw-concept-i4-gets-us-closer-to-whats-coming-in-2021/"> BMW i4</a>, an all-electric four-door Gran Coupe with an estimated EPA range of 270 miles and the ability to produce 530 horsepower, is slated to enter production in 2021. The iNEXT, which is meant to be the flagship of its EV lineup, is expected to be in production next year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Following <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/27/tech/google-work-from-home-extension/index.html">earlier reporting</a>, Google has confirmed that it will continue to allow employees to work from home through the end of June of next year. The company told TechCrunch that Sundar Pichai announced the plan in an email sent to staff earlier today. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;To give employees the ability to plan ahead, we are extending our global voluntary work from home option through June 30, 2021 for roles that don’t need to be in the office,” the CEO wrote. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The move marks the company’s most aggressive extension of its<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/10/google-expands-work-from-home-recommendation-to-all-north-american-employees-establishes-covid-19-fund/"> remote work policy to date</a>. Like many other tech companies, it appeared cautiously optimistic that things might return to normal after a couple of months. Lately, however, it’s clear that the threat of the COVID-19 pandemic won’t be going away any time soon. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Back in May, Pichai <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/26/google-campuses-reopening-covid-19/">outlined plans</a> to allow a small number of employees to return to various offices this month, all while maintaining social distancing and keeping buildings at around 10% occupancy. That<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>same month, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/12/twitter-says-staff-can-continue-working-from-home-permanently/">Twitter sent a memo</a> noting that staff would be able to continue working from home on a permanent basis. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Depending on how long the pandemic continues to rage on, it seems reasonable to expect that even the largest tech corporations are rethinking their approach to remote work. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mobile consumers are downloading and using more apps than ever before. According to <a href="https://www.appannie.com/en/insights/market-data/mobile-app-evolution-how-the-ecosystem-has-changed/">recent data from App Annie,</a> mobile users now have 93 apps on their phone as of the end of 2019, up from 85 apps at the end of 2015. They also now use around 41 apps per month, up from 35 in 2015. Related to this increase, users are now also spending more hours per day using apps. Worldwide, daily time spent in apps has grown to 3.1 hours per day in 2019, up from 2.1 hours per day in 2015, for instance.</p>
<p>But with that growth has also come increased diversity among the top apps, the report found. That means top apps now make up a smaller proportion of consumers&#8217; total time spent in apps, compared with five years ago.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that this report was commissioned by Facebook, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/app-annie" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="app-annie">App Annie <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> says, with a goal of offering a more detailed look at the evolving app ecosystem over the past five years. The report aims to determine how growth is playing out in terms of popular app categories, among the top publishers, and how quickly newly successful apps are achieving sizable growth.</p>
<p>Facebook, in the past, had generated this sort of market research data first-hand by way of its Onavo VPN application &#8212; now <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/21/facebook-removes-onavo/">shuttered</a> over privacy concerns &#8212; and other <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/29/facebook-project-atlas/">similar efforts</a>.</p>
<p>Turning to App Annie&#8217;s data team is just a new way for the company to get at the same sort of data.</p>
<p>App Annie&#8217;s market analysis, in part, is similarly derived by way of third-party apps. The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/05/28/app-annie-acquires-competitor-distimo-raises-another-17-million-from-existing-investors/">acquired Distimo in 2014</a>, and as of 2016 has run the VPN app Phone Guardian under the Distimo brand. It also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/05/06/app-annie-acquires-mobile-measurement-service-mobidia/">acquired Mobidia in 2015</a> and has operated My Data Manager (now on the App Store under Distimo). Both apps disclose their relationship with App Annie and explain that the apps are used for market research purposes, with specific examples of the type of data collected.</p>
<p>The new report&#8217;s findings may not be all good news for Facebook and other top app publishers. As the app economy evolved, users now have more places to spend time on mobile.</p>

<p>Over the past five years, worldwide downloads continued to grow to reach a record of 120 billion in 2019, with several key countries now driving growth, including India (10% year-over-year growth in 2019), Brazil (9%), Indonesia (8%) and Russia (7%).</p>
<p>Downloads in mature economies also hit record levels in 2019, including the U.S. (12.3 billion), Japan (2.5 billion), U.K. (2.1 billion), South Korea (2 billion), Germany (1.9 billion), and France (1.9 billion).</p>
<p>As users grew their time in app to 3.1 hours per day, they also began to use more of a variety of apps. According to the report, 35 of the top 100 apps were new entrants in 2019, up from 27 in 2016 across categories that included social, photography, video, communications, entertainment and more.</p>

<p>This is likely worrisome data for top app publishers, like Facebook, which has for years maintained a suite of top apps, including not only its flagship app, but also Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp. As the competitive pressure increases, these top apps make up a smaller proportion of the time spent on mobile devices as users have grown more comfortable trying out newcomers &#8212; particularly across gaming, entertainment and video categories.</p>
<p>The top 30 non-game apps accounted for 69.4% of U.S. users&#8217; total time spent in 2016 among non-games. That dropped to 65.5% in 2019, a nearly 4% decline. Among games, the share fell from 49% to 39%, a 10% drop. (This data was sourced from Google Play in the U.S.)</p>

<p>Not only are consumers more open to trying new apps, the report found that new apps can also quickly achieve app store success. In the U.S., for example, more than 60% of apps are able to reach their category&#8217;s Top 30 in their first six months.</p>
<p>This is aided by larger initial marketing pushes as well as improvements in terms of consumer&#8217;s devices themselves &#8212; like more storage and processing power, which encourages more downloads.</p>

<p>There are also more apps capable of achieving the once milestone metric of 1 million monthly active users (MAUs). In 2019, more than 4,600 apps saw 1 million MAUs, including those outside of social and communications like Netflix, Roku, Disney, CBS, Amazon, Alibaba, Walmart, Target, PayPal, Venmo, Chase, Capital One, Uber, DoorDash, McDonald&#8217;s and Starbucks.</p>

<p>Apps are also achieving the 1 million downloads milestones more quickly, in data analyzed from 2015 to 2018. In the video, finance, communications, social, photo and entertainment categories, 67% of apps achieved the 1 million downloads milestone within their first 12 months, App Annie says.</p>
<p>Because of the increases, there&#8217;s now a lot of overlap in between top apps. Today, mobile consumers will often choose and use multiple apps within and across categories to address similar needs, including on social, the report found.</p>
<p>For example, 89% of Snapchat&#8217;s users also used YouTube in April 2020 in the U.S., and 75% also used Instagram.</p>

<p>TikTok saw the greatest year-over-year increase in cross-app usage of Snapchat, rising from 17% in April 2019 to April 2020 &#8212; an indication of how much it has captured the youth demographic.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, video apps and gaming are taking up more of users&#8217; time spent in apps. This broad category of &#8220;play&#8221;-focused apps accounted for 22% of the growth in time spent in apps in 2019.</p>

<p>Plus, top gaming apps are also implementing social features, including Top 50 games like Fortnite, Clash of Clans, Call of Duty: Mobile, Township, Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, New Yahtzee with Buddies, Golf Clash and Slotomania, for example.</p>
<p>More than two-thirds of the Top 50 games have added at least one social feature, whether that&#8217;s inviting friend to play, social assists for progressing, guilds or clans or in-app chat. This, in turn, has led to players spending more time in games as they can connect with friends there.</p>

<p>Fortnite, as one key example of this trend, rolled out Party Hub based on its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/12/fortnite-maker-epic-acquires-social-video-app-houseparty/">acquired Houseparty technology</a>, in September 2019. In the three months after the rollout, time spent in Fortnite grew 130%.</p>

<p>Outside of games, TikTok has risen by blending elements of top categories like social, video and entertainment. After merging with Musical.ly, it has rapidly rolled out more video editing features and increased ad spend aggressively to grow its user base and drive engagement. By December 2019, U.S. users were spending 16 hours, 20 minutes in the app per month, on average, up from 5 hours, 4 minutes in August 2018.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.appannie.com/en/insights/market-data/mobile-app-evolution-how-the-ecosystem-has-changed/">The full report</a> also delves into country-by-country breakdowns but, overall, found that most countries saw record downloads in 2019 and similar trends in terms of app usage frequency increases and time spent.</p>
<p>One notable point of comparison is that U.S. users have more apps installed than in other markets (97 versus 93), but tend to use fewer apps compared with worldwide trends (36 versus 41). They also spend slightly fewer hours per day in apps, on average, than the worldwide average at 2.7 hours versus 3.1 hours.</p>
<p>&#8220;This report shows that the app industry is more competitive today than ever. New companies are succeeding with innovative apps that meet needs people might not even know they have,&#8221; said Ime Archibong, head of Facebook&#8217;s New Product Experimentation team, an internal team at Facebook looking to find new models for social apps. &#8220;All of this choice and competition fuels innovation, and that’s the heart of our work at Facebook,&#8221; he added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After launching <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/22/amazon-launches-new-alexa-developer-tools/">a number of new developer tools</a> for Alexa last week, Amazon today is introducing an updated version of its Alexa mobile app for consumers. The new app aims to offer a more personalized experience, particularly on users&#8217; home screens, and offers more instructions on how and when consumers can use the digital assistant, among other changes. Notably, the app has moved its third-party skill suggestions off the main screen, to increase focus on how consumers are actually using Alexa.</p>
<p>The redesign offers an updated home screen, with a big Alexa button now at the top informing users they can either tap or say &#8220;Alexa&#8221; to get started.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2022887" style="width: 688px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2022887" class="wp-image-2022887 size-large" style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Alexa-App-1.png?w=678" alt="" width="678" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Alexa-App-1.png 1044w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Alexa-App-1.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Alexa-App-1.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Alexa-App-1.png?resize=768,770 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Alexa-App-1.png?resize=678,680 678w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Alexa-App-1.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Alexa-App-1.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Alexa-App-1.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Alexa-App-1.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Alexa-App-1.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 678px) 100vw, 678px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2022887" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Amazon</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This is followed by a list of personalized suggestions based on what consumers&#8217; usage of the app indicates is important to them &#8212; whether that&#8217;s reminders, a recently played item like their music or an Audible book, access to their shopping list and so on.</p>
<p>Users may also see controls for features that are frequently accessed or currently active, like the volume level for their Echo devices, so they can pick up where they left off, Amazon says. It&#8217;s worth noting that these Echo devices could include Echo Buds, Amazon&#8217;s Alexa-powered wireless earbuds, which could be key to its plans of enabling <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/22/amazon-launches-new-alexa-developer-tools/">Alexa&#8217;s newly announced capabilities</a> for controlling mobile apps.</p>
<p>For first-time users, the Alexa app will offer more tips on what to do on mobile. For instance, new users may see suggestions about playing songs with Amazon Music or prompts to manage their Alexa Shopping List.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the app&#8217;s advanced features &#8212; like Reminders, Routines, Skills and Settings &#8212; have been relocated under the &#8220;More&#8221; button as part of the redesign.</p>
<p>The changes don&#8217;t necessarily mean Amazon has decluttered the Alexa home screen, however.</p>
<p>Because the update moved the Alexa button to the top of the screen, it has left room in the navigation bar for a new button: &#8220;Play,&#8221; which encourages media playback.</p>
<p>The revamp also suggests that Alexa&#8217;s dedicated app hasn&#8217;t exactly found its sweet spot to become part of users&#8217; daily lives.</p>
<p>Before, the app had featured the date and weather at the top of the screen &#8212; an indication that Amazon had hoped the app would be something of a daily dashboard. (See below). Now, the company seems to understand that users will launch the app when they want to do something Alexa-specific. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s making it easier to get to recent actions, so they can effectively pick up where they left off on whatever they were doing on their Echo smart speaker, for example.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2022886" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2022886" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2022886" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Image-from-iOS.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Image-from-iOS.png 1125w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Image-from-iOS.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Image-from-iOS.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Image-from-iOS.png?resize=768,1663 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Image-from-iOS.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Image-from-iOS.png?resize=709,1536 709w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Image-from-iOS.png?resize=946,2048 946w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Image-from-iOS.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2022886" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Current Alexa app, screenshot via TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>In addition, the new app notably deprioritizes Alexa&#8217;s third-party voice apps (aka &#8220;skills&#8221;), which have not yet evolved into an app ecosystem to rival its mobile counterparts, like the Apple App Store for iOS apps or Google Play. Studies have indicated a <a href="https://voicebot.ai/2018/10/05/61-of-alexa-skills-still-have-no-ratings-and-only-1-have-more-than-100/">large number of Alexa skills</a> weren&#8217;t being used, and as a result, the <a href="https://www.adweek.com/digital/new-voice-apps-are-declining-as-a-breakout-hit-remains-elusive/">pace of new skills releases has slowed</a>.</p>
<p>Instead of showcasing popular skills on the home screen, as before, the app&#8217;s &#8220;Skills &amp; Games&#8221; section has been shuffled off to the &#8220;More&#8221; tab. Amazon&#8217;s first-party experiences, like shopping, media playback and communications, now take up this crucial home screen real estate.</p>
<p>Amazon says the new app is rolling out worldwide over the month ahead on iOS, Android and Fire OS devices. By late August, all users should be migrated to the new experience.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When it comes to building a company, lots of things can and do go wrong. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/margit-wennmachers" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="margit-wennmachers">Margit Wennmachers <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> &#8212; an operating partner at Andreessen Horowitz and long one of the most powerful public relations pros in the startup world &#8212; knows this firsthand.</p>
<p>Thankfully for all of you, Wennmachers was able to join us for our recent Early Stage event, where she shared some of her tips and tricks for dealing with everything from fast-ballooning crises that reporters catch wind of, to laying off people during a pandemic, to why lawsuits can actually fuel some companies&#8217; growth.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s advice you might save for future reference. As she noted, how a crisis is handled can make or break a startup, and the list of things that can go wrong at even the smallest outfit is &#8220;long,&#8221; including a product needing to be recalled, a site going down, a cyber breach, a founding team that doesn&#8217;t get along, inappropriate behavior, lawsuits and cultural issues.</p>
<p>Some of her most actionable advice included:</p>
<h2>Prepare for the inevitable crisis</h2>
<p>First, said Wennmachers, spend time modeling out the scenarios, and &#8220;let your imagination run wild&#8221; as you do. Spend a month on this if necessary. As you&#8217;re thinking of worst-case scenarios, also figure out the team that would be involved in a crisis response. Legal will always have to be involved but also, often, HR, outside counsel, and, if a startup can afford it, the help of an outside crisis communications team. If it&#8217;s a product failure, you&#8217;ll also need the product lead, too, she noted.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The coronavirus caused some disagreement amongst Boston’s venture capital community. Looking back at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/18/13-boston-focused-investors-explain-present-life-in-the-startup-hub/">our mid-2020 survey</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/30/13-boston-focused-venture-capitalists-talk-green-shoots-and-startup-recovery/">of its VCs</a>, some saw the city’s strength in biotech and healthcare as a competitive advantage, while others saw Boston’s diverse startup ecosystem as key to its survival.</p>
<p>And some were worried that activity was about to clamp down. <a href="https://twitter.com/bussgang">Jeff Bussgang</a>, <a href="https://www.flybridge.com/">Flybridge Ventures</a>, put it most frankly: “Q2 financing for Boston is going to fall off a cliff. The biotech industry may see some bright spots […] but the financing market has frozen up as solid as the Charles River in February.”</p>
<p>With fresh data in hand, it appears that the more bullish were more right than the bears and that, in a good turn of affairs for Boston startups, Bussgang was wrong.</p>
<p>The city, much like the country, did not see the sharply negative quarter that many anticipated. Boston posted record venture capital investment in the period, its highest total since at least Q3 2018 according <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/">to CB Insights data</a>.</p>
<p>The same dataset also says that Boston-area companies raised $3.7 billion across 126 deals. Indeed, the good news from Boston’s Q1 bested better-than-anticipated-results from both <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/13/second-quarter-vc-investing-totals-appear-lackluster/">the global venture capital community</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/14/covid-19-fails-to-stop-the-march-of-the-unicorns/">the domestic VC world in Q2</a>.</p>
<p>Bussgang sent an updated metaphor to the TechCrunch team in response to this data: “It was a tundra in March and April but, as happens in Boston, April showers and May flowers kicked in and the financing markets started to gush again in the late spring/early summer, just in time to save <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/q2" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="q2">Q2 <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>.”</p>
<p>While the data isn’t historically definitive due to reporting lags, it can be used as a directional sign that Boston’s rebound isn’t ahead of us, it’s upon us.</p>
<p>The solid numbers are a sign that COVID-19 and economic turmoil have put many startups in greater demand than before, which means that they need to amass money to meet growth needs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A rare public showdown between Congress and the CEOs of tech&#8217;s biggest companies is still on track after being postponed last week. The House Judiciary Committee hearing, originally set for Monday, will now take place Wednesday, July 29 at 12 PM Eastern Time. The date was changed in light of the death of the civil rights leader and Georgia Representative John Lewis, who will be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/27/us/politics/john-lewis-memorial.html">honored in a ceremony Monday</a> in the Capitol building.</p>
<p>The hearing, titled &#8220;<a href="https://judiciary.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=3114">Online Platforms and Market Power, Part 6: Examining the Dominance of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google</a>,&#8221; will see an unusually comprehensive cast of tech&#8217;s most powerful leaders face off with lawmakers.</p>
<p>Any hearing that manages to drag <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/04/how-to-stream-tech-hearings-facebook-twitter/">a single tech CEO</a> to Washington, D.C. — even virtually, in this case — is notable, and Wednesday&#8217;s hearing will hear testimony from four of them. In the hearing, Amazon&#8217;s Jeff Bezos, Apple&#8217;s Tim Cook, Google&#8217;s Sundar Pichai and Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook will all face questions about their company practices and concerns that anti-competitive behavior is impacting some of tech&#8217;s key markets for the worse.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The hearing is the latest chapter in the House Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee&#8217;s <a href="https://judiciary.house.gov/issues/issue/?IssueID=14921">ongoing antitrust investigation</a> targeting many of tech&#8217;s largest, most powerful companies that was first announced last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since last June, the Subcommittee has been investigating the dominance of a small number of digital platforms and the adequacy of existing antitrust laws and enforcement,&#8221; House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler and Antitrust Subcommittee Chairman <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/19/facebook-cicilline-antitrust-house-congress/">David Cicilline</a> said in a joint statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Given the central role these corporations play in the lives of the American people, it is critical that their CEOs are forthcoming. As we have said from the start, their testimony is essential for us to complete this investigation.&#8221;</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll be following the hearing closely on Wednesday. If you stumble onto this page the day of, the link below should provide a reliable stream.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tech companies are increasingly finding that accessibility isn&#8217;t a widget you plug into an otherwise final product, but something that&#8217;s integrated from the very beginning of development — but that takes resources few possess. <a href="https://www.makeitfable.com/">Fable hopes to make disability-inclusive design easier</a> by providing testing and development assistance from disabled folks on-demand and has raised a $1.5M seed round to do it.</p>
<p>&#8220;The person who experiences this problem is usually the best one to solve it,&#8221; Alwar Pillai, co-founder of Fable, told TechCrunch. But that&#8217;s rarely how it works with accessibility features.</p>
<p>More often than not, she said, the people developing them are able and under 40. &#8220;It&#8217;s under-prioritized and incomplete,&#8221; Pillai said. &#8220;It&#8217;s not about, is this product really usable by a blind person? Businesses should be consulting with disabled folks, and Fable is a platform that connects digital teams to them so they can include them in building and testing from the get-go.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="XpKftQG5Xr"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/18/somehow-twitter-does-not-have-a-team-dedicated-to-accessibility/">Somehow, Twitter does not have a team dedicated to accessibility</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Somehow, Twitter does not have a team dedicated to accessibility&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/18/somehow-twitter-does-not-have-a-team-dedicated-to-accessibility/embed/#?secret=XpKftQG5Xr" data-secret="XpKftQG5Xr" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Fable provides on-demand access to people with various disabilities that need to be considered during the design process. Prototypes or mockups can be sent to individuals on call, who then return an evaluation within 48 hours.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most companies have huge digital products, but no idea what it&#8217;s like for people with disabilities, like that a signup flow takes an hour for a blind person,&#8221; said co-founder and COO Abid Virani. &#8220;So we put a couple prototypes in front of, maybe, someone quadriplegic or low-vision who has to zoom in a lot, and observe how they go through that. They&#8217;ll give feedback on all kinds of stuff you don&#8217;t expect.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course customers can pick and choose which disabilities, assistive technologies and platforms they want to target and test, for example blind users on mobile browsers.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2021524" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/custom-800x409-1.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2021524" class="wp-image-2021524 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/custom-800x409-1.png" alt=" Examples of custom audience groups that can be created on Fable’s platform including mobile screen reader users and low vision on all devices." width="800" height="409" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/custom-800x409-1.png 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/custom-800x409-1.png?resize=150,77 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/custom-800x409-1.png?resize=300,153 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/custom-800x409-1.png?resize=768,393 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/custom-800x409-1.png?resize=680,348 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/custom-800x409-1.png?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2021524" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Fable</p></div></p>
<p>It&#8217;s important, Pillai and Virani emphasized, that this process takes place during development and doesn&#8217;t slow it down, otherwise it will be left to the end of development and considered a necessity for ADA compliance rather than actually being about accessibility.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can be compliant and still have a bad site,&#8221; noted Virani, but companies don&#8217;t tend to have the ability to recognize that, since they rarely have disabled testers.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also the consideration that with large products, there are all kinds of integrations, plugins and partners that may or may not be accessible, yet are important parts of the experience. If your ostensibly accessible site hands things over to a payment provider at the last minute that&#8217;s difficult to navigate, it&#8217;s not <em>really</em> accessible.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s throwing away a lot of business, Pillai pointed out. &#8220;These are people with billions in disposable income, and they&#8217;re untapped,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a market opportunity.&#8221; But only if companies design for accessibility from the start.</p>
<p>Not only that, but with the pandemic creating a shift to working from home, disabilities that were no problem in the office may prove troublesome with remote tools.</p>
<p>In addition to supplying experienced people with disabilities for testing — and providing those people with steady work, which for some can be difficult to come by — Fable is hoping to create and publicize <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/ideas/principles/design-systems/accessibility-in-design-systems/">improved testing methodologies</a> and get data out there to improve the status quo.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s $1.5 million round was led by Disruption Ventures in Canada (where the company is based) and Village Global in Silicon Valley. &#8220;We wanted people who believed we could do social good <em>and</em> build a billion dollar business,&#8221; said Virani.</p>
<p>With the Americans with Disabilities Act having just turned 30 yesterday, it&#8217;s clear we&#8217;ve come a long way since the &#8217;90s — but not only have we still got a lot of work to do, but it&#8217;s ongoing work. Building accessibility and inclusivity into development and testing at a fundamental level should help keep those goals in sight.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/27/equity-monday-sap-qualtrics-and-oh-boy-are-we-excited/">the morning show went out</a>, the Equity crew could not shut up about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/26/sap-will-spin-out-its-8b-spin-in-qualtrics-acquisition/">the Qualtrics-SAP deal</a>, so we had no choice but to jump back into recording mode for an off-the-cuff Equity Shot. As always, Shots are short-form Equity episodes that focus on a single, news topic.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>Building off of Danny&#8217;s SAP knowledge, Natasha&#8217;s curiosity about the future <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/qualtrics" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="qualtrics">Qualtrics <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> S-1, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/27/why-is-sap-spinning-qualtrics-out-via-an-ipo/">my own recent dive into the SAP and Qualtrics numbers</a>, we managed to cover quite a lot of ground. So, if you wanted to know:</p>
<ol>
<li>Why did SAP have to pay so much for Qualtrics back in the day?</li>
<li>Why is SAP willing to part with Qualtrics so soon after buying it?</li>
<li>How much might Qualtrics be worth?</li>
<li>And, of course, did the Equity team expect to see this news in 2020?</li>
</ol>
<p>Then you are probably going to like what we have in store for you.</p>
<p>Spoiler on that last as the answer is a firm <em>no</em>, but, all the same, what fun. That&#8217;s about it for this Equity Shot, hit play, have fun, and we are back Friday morning unless something else happens, like a Palantir S-1.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sport and fitness tech giant <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/garmin" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="garmin">Garmin <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has confirmed its five-day outage was caused by a ransomware attack.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200727005634/en/Garmin%C2%AE-issues-statement-outage/?=july-26-2020">a brief statement</a> on Monday, the company said it was hit by a cyberattack on July 23 that &#8220;encrypted some of our systems.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As a result, many of our online services were interrupted including website functions, customer support, customer facing applications and company communications,&#8221; the statement read. &#8220;We immediately began to assess the nature of the attack and started remediation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Garmin said it had &#8220;no indication&#8221; that customer data was accessed, lost or stolen. The company said its services are being restored.</p>
<p class="p1">The attack caused massive disruption to the company’s online services, used by millions of users, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20200723203514/https://connect.garmin.com/status/">including Garmin Connect</a>, which syncs user activity and data to the cloud and other devices. The attack also <a href="https://status.flygarmin.com/">took down flyGarmin</a>, its aviation navigation and route-planning service.</p>
<p>The tech maker previously attributed the incident to an &#8220;outage,&#8221; but sources familiar with the incident told TechCrunch that the outage was caused by file-encrypting malware.</p>
<p>TechCrunch previously reported that the attack was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/25/garmin-outage-ransomware-sources/">caused by the WastedLocker ransomware</a>, citing a source with direct knowledge of the incident. WastedLocker is known to be used by a Russian hacking group, known as Evil Corp., which was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury last year.</p>
<p>By imposing sanctions, the Treasury would have effectively made it illegal for any U.S. company to pay a ransom to get their files back.</p>
<p>During the outage, Garmin&#8217;s stock price fell from $102 to $94 per share. By afternoon trading on Monday, Garmin was up 3% to $100 per share.</p>
<p>Garmin is expected to report earnings on Wednesday.</p>

<p>As a result of the pandemic, accelerators have moved operations fully remote to abide by social distancing. The shift has forced well-known programs like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/26/500-startups-moves-to-rolling-admissions-instead-of-cohorts/">500 Startups</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/20/y-combinator-officially-shifts-its-next-accelerator-class-to-fully-remote-format/#:~:text=After%20being%20forced%20to%20quickly,Michael%20Seibel%20announced%20the%20move.">Y Combinator</a> and <a href="https://www.techstars.com/the-line/pov/the-pivot-to-virtual-getting-the-most-out-of-a-remote-accelerator">Techstars</a> to go fully online, while encouraging existing venture capital firms to launch new digital-only fellowships like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/28/cleo-capitals-sarah-kunst-launches-a-fellowship-for-laid-off-workers/">Cleo Capital</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/20/nextview-ventures-is-launching-a-remote-accelerator-for-startups/">NextView Ventures</a>.</p>
<p>Before the pandemic, accelerators could advertise <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alejandrocremades/2018/08/07/top-10-startup-accelerators-based-on-successful-exits/#7ad161ea4b3b">their value</a> by lending desk space once used by <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-y-combinator-saved-airbnb-2020-2">Airbnb,</a> <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/500-startups#section-exits">Twilio</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/19/brex-picks-up-57m-to-build-an-easy-credit-card-for-startups/">Brex</a>’s co-founders, plus a glitzy demo day. Now, stripped of their in-person element, the actual value of an accelerator program &#8212; and the network they provide &#8212; is being tested in new ways.</p>
<p>So a question remains for participating founders: Are they getting the benefits of what they thought they signed up for?</p>
<h2><strong>In the Zoom where it happened</strong></h2>
<p>The last thing <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-vega-sanz-467044106/">Michael Vega-Sanz</a> wanted to do was was join another Zoom get-together for entrepreneurs. But the <a href="https://www.lularides.com/">car-sharing company</a> he co-founded with twin brother <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-vega-sanz/">Matthew</a> was in the middle of a pivot, so they joined NextView Ventures’ <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/20/nextview-ventures-is-launching-a-remote-accelerator-for-startups/">inaugural remote accelerator program</a>.</p>
<p>“I envisioned an accelerator with awkward happy hours, mass Zoom calls,” Vega-Sanz said. Fast-forward one month into the program, he says it “has been quite the opposite.”</p>
<p>Before joining NextView’s accelerator, Vega-Sanz did an in-person incubator at Babson College in Boston, but there’s &#8220;a lot less fluff&#8221; in being virtual, he told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>“[With in-person] the reality was you’d go to lunch, and by the time you drove over there and had all your side talk, small talk, chit-chat and actually got into the nitty-gritty of the event, there was a lot of time loss,” he said. “You could have been working for your company during that time.”</p>
<p>If possible, Vega-Sanz still recommends that first-time founders attend a physical accelerator instead of a virtual one for the energy it brings, even with the downside of useless events.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>The Station is a weekly newsletter dedicated to all things transportation. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">Sign up here — just click The Station — to receive it every Saturday in your inbox</a>. </em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome back to The Station, a newsletter dedicated to all the present and future ways people and packages move from Point A to Point B.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s that whacky time of year when the heavens open and earnings fall from the sky, giving us precious insight into publicly traded companies. Over at TechCrunch we closely follow startups; we also keep an eye on publicly traded companies — a list that is growing in this summer of the SPAC. My earnings highlight this week is <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/tesla-motors" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="tesla-motors">Tesla, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> an often polarizing company that has had an unprecedented stock run up since March.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>I&#8217;ve been writing about Tesla for nearly a decade. Its earnings reports, and the reactions to them, are fascinating. The company&#8217;s second-quarter earnings report was no different. At first glance, Tesla appears to have won on all fronts, managing to extend its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/22/tesla-stretches-profit-streak-to-four-quarters-gains-6-in-after-hours-trading/">profitability streak to four quarters</a> — its longest period of profitability to date — despite headwinds from the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re here to provide a complete picture of each company we write about. Here are other details that matter beyond the bottom line.</p>
<p>Tesla revenue was nearly flat compared to last quarter and down 5% from the same period last year. Tesla was able hit its profit mark after slashing operating expenses and taking in $428 million of regulatory credit revenue — (regulatory credits accounted for roughly 400% of 2Q GAAP profit, per Morgan Stanley). Tesla CFO Zachary Kirkhorn said during the earnings call that Tesla expects to double its revenue from regulatory credits in 2020 over last year. He also said he expects regulatory credit sales to decline eventually.</p>
<p>One upside surprise: Tesla generated a positive $418 million of free cash flow in the quarter, which was much better than anticipated.</p>
<p>Finally, watch for capital expenditures and operating costs in the second half of the year. Tesla is going through an unprecedented expansion and says it will have three factories under construction — Berlin, China and Texas — this year. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/22/tesla-picks-austin-for-its-next-u-s-factory-to-build-cybertruck-semi-truck-model-y/">Texas factory</a>, which will produce the Cybertruck, Tesla Semi and the Model Y and Model 3 for the East Coast, was also announced on the call.</p>

<p>Micromobility companies Dott, Lime and Tier Mobility scored a huge win this week and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/23/lime-dott-and-tier-win-paris-scooter-permits-delivering-bird-a-loss-in-a-key-market/">secured permits to operate in Paris</a>, one of a handful of cities in the world that have become key battlegrounds over market share in the shared scooter and bike industry.</p>
<p>About 16 companies were vying for a spot. Bird is perhaps the most visible loser in this gambit. Just a year ago, the U.S. scooter pioneer made a big bet on the French market and announced plans to open its biggest European office in Paris. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/bird" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-type="organization" data-entity="bird">Bird</a> said at the time that it wanted to hire 1,000 people by mid-2021.</p>
<p>Other companies that applied for the permit included Bolt, Comodule, Spin, Voi and Wind.</p>
<p>Paris is viewed as one of a handful of prime marketplaces to deploy scooters. How important is Paris? William Henderson, CEO of Ride Report, put it to me this way in a recent interview.</p>
<p>&#8220;A small handful of companies will go out of business as a result of not getting that one permit — that&#8217;s how big a deal it is, just that one market.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>In other micromobbin&#8217; news this week &#8230;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bicycles</strong> have become a tool used by <a href="https://chi.streetsblog.org/2020/07/20/after-cops-seize-bike-marshals-rides-at-protest-cycling-community-rallies-behind-them/#new_tab">protestors and police</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Cowboy</strong> has raised a $26 million (€23 million) in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/23/electric-bike-maker-cowboy-raises-26-million/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">Series B funding round</a> from Exor Seeds, HCVC, Isomer Capital, Future Positive Capital and Index Ventures. The startup has been manufacturing premium electric bikes and selling them directly to consumers around Europe.</p>
<p><strong>Google Maps</strong> has rolled out some new features for bicyclists as demand for safe routes has skyrocketed. Since February, requests for cycling directions in Google Maps have jumped by 69%, according to Google. The app now has end-to-end directions that include docked bike share information. For some cities, Maps will show users links to open the relevant bike share app to book and unlock the bike. The <a href="https://blog.google/products/maps/ride-easy-new-biking-features-google-maps/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+blogspot%2FMKuf+%28The+Keyword+%7C+Official+Google+Blog%29">blog post</a> is worth a read, if only to understand how Google Maps determines the best route.</p>
<p><strong>SoundCloud</strong> founders Eric Quidenus-Wahlforss and Alexander Ljung, together with the co-founder of Jimdo, Christian Springub, have launched a new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/21/former-soundcloud-founders-launch-e-bike-subscription-service-backed-by-blueyard/">subscription e-bike service</a> called <a href="https://www.dance.co/">Dance</a>. The invite-only program kicks-off first in Berlin, with an all-inclusive service package of a €59-a-month “introductory price” and its own design of e-bike. The founders’ goal is to emphasize the community aspects of the rental service, just as they did with SoundCloud.</p>
<h2>Deal of the week</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1896226 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png" alt="money the station" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=1536,384 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>A PSA about deals. This is going to sound like an obvious message, but alas, conversations with folks at several transportation startups in the past two months have prompted me to spell it out here. The details, or terms, of deals and partnerships matter. I try to provide the most complete reporting possible when I cover partnership announcements, despite efforts by companies to keep terms secret or to paint a rosier-than-reality picture of the deal. &#8220;Try&#8221; is the important word. I&#8217;m not always successful.</p>
<p>Take the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/tusimple-llc" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="tusimple-llc">TuSimple <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> — Navistar deal announced last week. The two companies said they would develop and begin producing autonomous semi trucks by 2024. It also involved Navistar taking an undisclosed stake in the startup.</p>
<p>This appeared to be a critical win for TuSimple, the autonomous trucking startup with operations in China and the U.S. The timing of the announcement was also important; I learned and reported last month that TuSimple was starting to shop around for at least <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/26/tusimple-seeking-250-million-in-new-funding-to-scale-self-driving-trucks/">$250 million in new funding</a>.</p>
<p>However, what wasn&#8217;t clear until <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/the-biggest-self-driving-truck-startup-stumbles-in-hitting-high-goals">The Information&#8217;s reporters</a> talked to folks familiar with the deal, is that TuSimple is expected to pay Navistar &#8220;tens of millions of dollars per year for at least several years to develop and gain access to Navistar trucks.&#8221; TuSimple also &#8220;gave&#8221; Navistar an equity stake.</p>
<p>The partnership may very well end up being fruitful for both companies. That doesn&#8217;t change the fact that this deal has an unusual structure and illustrates the challenges that TuSimple as well as other self-driving trucking startups face as they try to form partnerships with legacy manufacturers.</p>
<p><strong>Other deals that got our attention this week …</strong></p>
<p><strong>Claims Genius</strong>, a company that provides instant vehicle damage assessment using computer vision and artificial intelligence technology, <a href="https://www.prweb.com/releases/claim_genius_raises_5_5_million_in_series_a_funding/prweb17269379.htm">raised $5.5 million</a> in a Series A funding round that included investments from Malaysia-based Financial Link and SIRI Info Solutions.</p>

<p><strong><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/get-taxi" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="get-taxi">Gett</strong>, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> the ride-hailing company based in Israel and London, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/21/gett-raises-100m-more-to-double-down-on-its-b2b-on-demand-ride-business/">raised $100 million</a> to fund its B2B business, which CEO and founder Dave Waiser says is growing &#8212; not shrinking or staying flat &#8212; in the midst of the global health pandemic. The company has raised, to date, $750 million, with investors including VW, Access and its founder Len Blavatnik, Kreos, MCI and more, and its last valuation was $1.5 billion, pegged to a $200 million fundraise in May 2019.</p>
<p><strong><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/hertz" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="hertz">Hertz <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Global Holdings Inc.</strong> reached an agreement that will cut the debt it owes lenders who financed its rental car fleet to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-24/hertz-to-cut-6-billion-in-vehicle-debt-by-year-end-lawyer-says">less than $5 billion</a> from $11 billion by Dec. 31. As part of the deal, Hertz has agreed to sell 182,000 cars over the next few months. Hertz also has to make $650 million in lease payments.</p>
<p><strong>Sea Machines Robotics</strong>, an autonomous ship navigation startup, <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/07/22/sea-machines-raises-15-million-for-its-autonomous-ship-navigation-technology/">raised $15 million</a> in Series B funding round led by Accomplice. Brunswick, Eniac VC, Geekdom Fund, LaunchCapital, NextGen Venture Partners and Toyota AI Ventures also joined the round.</p>

<p><strong>Sibros</strong>, a connected vehicle platform company, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sibros-closes-12-million-series-a-for-first-deep-connected-vehicle-platform-301095757.html">raised $12 million</a> in Series A funding, bringing its total capital raised to more than $15 million. The round was led by Nexus Venture Partners with participation from Moneta Ventures and Twin Ventures. Sibros has developed a platform that connects and manages all vehicle software inventory and configurations as well as collects data from every sensor and component. The upshot? The platform is designed so automakers can provide in-vehicle firmware updates as well as advanced analytics.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s an additional roundup of transportation news that got my attention.</p>
<h3>Autonomous vehicles</h3>
<p><strong>Amazon</strong> is taking its autonomous delivery robot Scout on the road. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/21/amazons-scout-robot-deliveries-expand-to-additional-cities-in-georgia-and-tennessee/">Scout will expand</a> operations to two cities in the American Southeast: Atlanta, Georgia and Franklin, Tennessee.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary"><strong>Aurora</strong>, the autonomous vehicle technology startup backed by Amazon, is expanding into Texas as it aims to accelerate the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/20/aurora-expands-to-texas-in-bid-to-ramp-up-self-driving-truck-efforts/">development of self-driving trucks</a>. The company plans to test commercial routes in the Dallas-Fort Worth area with a mix of Fiat Chrysler Pacifica minivans and Class 8 trucks. A small fleet of Pacificas will arrive first. The trucks will be on the road in Texas by the end of the year, Aurora said.</p>
<p><strong>Kiwibot</strong>, the delivery robot startup that got its start shuttling burritos and snacks to students on the University of California, Berkeley campus, is expanding to San Jose with a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/21/kiwibot-delivery-robots-head-to-san-jose-with-new-partners-shopify-and-ordermark/">new business model</a> and partners Shopify and Ordermark.</p>
<p><strong><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/waymo" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="waymo">Waymo</strong> <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/21/waymo-and-fiat-chrysler-expand-partnership-to-develop-self-driving-ram-vans/">struck a deal</a> to develop and test autonomous cargo vans and other light commercial vehicles designed to shuttle goods. The agreement is an expansion of a partnership that kicked off four years ago with a focus on self-driving Pacifica hybrid minivans meant to transport people.</p>
<p>A few items are worth noting here (bear with me). The initial plan is to integrate Waymo’s self-driving stack — the suite of software and hardware that allows the vehicle to operate without a human behind the wheel — into <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/fca-sp-z-o-o" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="fca-sp-z-o-o">FCA’s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Ram ProMaster vans. These self-driving cargo vans will be used by Waymo Via, the company’s trucking and local delivery service.</p>
<p class="p1">It appears that the terms of the deal could extend far beyond Waymo Via. It’s possible that FCA could supply other transport companies with the self-driving vans (equipped with Waymo tech) through a licensing deal. It&#8217;s also important to note that the partnership covers FCA’s entire portfolio of vehicles. Folks familiar with the deal tell me it also extends to future affiliates. This point matters because FCA and French automaker Groupe PSA are in the process of merging into a newly formed corporation called Stellantis. If the 50-50 merger closes as expected in the first quarter of next year, the agreement would theoretically include all the brands that fall under Stellantis.</p>
<p>Finally, you might recall that FCA announced a partnership with Aurora last year. It turns out that this was a memorandum of understanding to work together, an agreement that has since run its course and ended, a spokesperson said. The two companies are still working on custom-built Pacifica hybrids, which Aurora is using in its testing. They are not developing autonomous commercial vans.</p>

<p><strong>Audi</strong> CEO Markus Duesmann conceded that Tesla has a <a href="https://www.autonews.com/sales/audi-expects-pre-pandemic-sales-levels-2022-23">significant technological lead</a> in several areas, including in battery tech. Audi is making efforts to catch up. For instance, the company is researching <a href="https://www.audi-mediacenter.com/en/press-releases/electric-cars-as-part-of-the-energy-transitionaudi-is-researching-bidirectional-charging-technology-12996">bi-directional charging</a> that would integrate electric vehicles into the domestic power grid.</p>

<p><strong>Ford</strong> took a page out of Tesla&#8217;s playbook and unveiled a special edition of its forthcoming four-door electric Mustang. This one-off has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/21/ford-takes-cues-from-teslas-playbook-with-1400-hp-electric-mustang-mach-e/">seven electric motors</a> producing a total of 1,400 HP, which to put into layman’s terms, is a shit-ton of power.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary"><strong>General Motors</strong> is on track to deliver 20 electric vehicles by 2023, the company said in its latest sustainability report. That includes models for nearly all of its brands, including Cadillac, GMC, Chevrolet and Buick. Most of these vehicles will use GM’s new modular EV architecture, called Ultium. Matt Burns provides an overview on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/20/gm-details-12-upcoming-electric-vehicles-from-cadillac-gmc-chevrolet-and-buick/">12 upcoming models</a>.</p>

<p>The <strong>U.S. Department of Transportation</strong> and the NETT Council issued a document that provides a guidance for <a href="https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/2020-07/NETT_Pathways_jul20_final_3.pdf">emerging transportation technology</a>, including hyperloop. Importantly, it establishes <span class="il">hyperloop</span>’s eligibility for federal funding for projects.</p>
<p>“We have determined that these <span class="il">hyperloop</span> projects are just as eligible for grant as any maglev or magnetic levitation project,” said Finch Fulton, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Transportation Policy during the live-streamed event. “This includes the Federal Railroad Administration Consolidated Rail Infrastructure and Safety Improvements (CRISI) Program, the Office of the Secretary BUILD and INFRA grants, and programs of that sort. This also means that they would be eligible for some of the Department’s loan and lending programs.”</p>
<p><strong>Volkswagen</strong> wants to turn its cloud-based software and data portal called the Industrial Cloud Network into a broader marketplace for other manufacturing and technology companies. The Industrial Cloud Network, designed by VW and Amazon Web Services (AWS) as well as integration partner Siemens, would operate like an app store. M<span lang="DE">anufacturing technology and partner companies will be able to collaborate on new software applications and eventually connect</span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> VW factories around the world to its global suppliers.</span></p>

<blockquote><p>“The CrunchMatch networking platform, which is basically speed-dating for techies, was very helpful. I scheduled at least 10 short, precise meetings. I learned about startups in stealth mode, what big corporations were up to — things not yet picked up by the press. It was great, and I followed up on three or four of those connections.” — Jens Lehmann, technical lead and product manager, SAP.</p></blockquote>
